# MNIST ViT Exploration
This repo shows my explorations into using Vision Transformers for image classification of the MNIST data set. This is my first implementation of transformers and heavily relied on online resources and papers for implementation. The model follows a typical Vision Transformer implementation with a transformer encoder and a simple feed forward layer for classification.
